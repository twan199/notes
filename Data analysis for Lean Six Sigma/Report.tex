\subsection{Measure}
Goal: Make the problem quantifiable and measurable. How to operationalize the problem. 
Find process metrics that are relevant for the project objectives. What characteristcs should you measure.

\emph{Example}
Mondays process wafer making runs worse than other days? Why is that. What to measure time --> means Duration of start up and Start time production and runs worse --> Amount of scrap per day and volume per day.

These variables are called \textbf{CTQ}'s. 
\textbf{CTQ} (Critical to quality characteristics): A property of a process, process or service that is relevant to the project objective.
How to find CTQ:
ask yourself: What metric do I want to change? Will the project be succesful if I do that / Does it solve the problem. Other names Y-variable, Dependend variable or Outcome variable.

Examples are \textit{Processing time} time it takes to do a process (often minutes) and \textit{Throughput time} total duration of processing the change (days). Be critical to determination of CTQ: really contribute to goal?

Unit vs measurement unit.
Unit: People, objects, phenonema: the things you collect data on. Measure speed highway --> unit is vehicles. Also known as Experimental unit, observational unit, unit of analysis, case, subject.
Measurement unit: defines what a measument means. The properties of things you collect data on --> km/h

Why sampling is sometimes good idea: 1) cannot measure all data points, 2) when it provides more precise information about a part of the population instead of vague info about all population. 
Sample has to be resprensentative. 

Dataset: unit in row, variables in columns. Variables are properties that are measured.
