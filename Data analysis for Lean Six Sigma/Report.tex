\subsection{Measure}
Goal: Make the problem quantifiable and measurable. How to operationalize the problem. 
Find process metrics that are relevant for the project objectives. What characteristics should you measure.

\emph{Example}
Mondays process wafer making runs worse than other days? Why is that. What to measure time --> means Duration of start up and Start time production and runs worse --> Amount of scrap per day and volume per day.

These variables are called \textbf{CTQ}'s. 
\textbf{CTQ} (Critical to quality characteristics): A property of a process, process or service that is relevant to the project objective.
How to find CTQ:
ask yourself: What metric do I want to change? Will the project be successful if I do that / Does it solve the problem. Other names Y-variable, Dependent variable or Outcome variable.

Examples are \textit{Processing time} time it takes to do a process (often minutes) and \textit{Throughput time} total duration of processing the change (days). Be critical to determination of CTQ: really contribute to goal?

Unit vs measurement unit.
Unit: People, objects, phenomena: the things you collect data on. Measure speed highway --> unit is vehicles. Also known as Experimental unit, observational unit, unit of analysis, case, subject.
Measurement unit: defines what a measurement means. The properties of things you collect data on --> km/h

Why sampling is sometimes good idea: 1) cannot measure all data points, 2) when it provides more precise information about a part of the population instead of vague info about all population. 
Sample has to be representative. 

Data-set: unit in row, variables in columns. Variables are properties that are measured.

Numerical vs Categorical data
Numerical contains more information.
Amount of datapoints needed
\begin{itemize}
    \item Categorical CTQ: 300
    \item Numerical CTQ: 30
\end{itemize}
Difference in visualizing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Categorical CTQ: Pie, bar, pareto chart
    \item Numerical CTQ: Histogram, boxplot
\end{itemize}

Before you analyse data: describtive statistics (mean, se mean, stdev, min, q1, median, q3, max)
Range = max - min
Interquartile range (IQR) = q3 - q1

80-20 principle: focus on few vital issues instead of many trivial

\begin{tabular}{l|l l}
Plot type & x-variable & y-variable (CTQ) \\ \hline
Scatterplot & Numerical & Numerical \\
Boxplot & Categorical & Numerical \\
Boxplot with groups (transposed) & Numerical & Categorical \\
Stacked bar chart or cross tabulation & Categorical & Categorical \\
\end{tabular}
\\
\begin{tabular}{l|l l}
Regression type & x-variable & y-variable (CTQ) \\ \hline
Regression & Numerical & Numerical \\
ANOVA (Normal dist.) or Kruskal-Wallis (Nonnorm.) & Categorical & Numerical \\
Logistic regression & Numerical & Categorical \\
Chi square test & Categorical & Categorical \\
\end{tabular}
Few data points --> two sample student t-test can be used.

Regression steps
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fitted line plot: Fit a line (linear regression) $y = a + bX$ that describes the relationship
    \item Regression: Is the evidence for this relationship significant
    \item Residuals: Are the residuals normal. Are there any outliers or irregularities
    \item Optional - Prediction interval: Bounds for 95\% of data points
\end{enumerate}
if $p<0.05$ the relationship is significant. $R^2$ should be large.
Quadratic regression is $y=a+bX-cX^2$

Instead of normal distribution, for throughput times or processing times, a Weibull distribution can be used or lognormal. 
Probability plot, lowest AD value fits best. Probaility plot tells you which distribution to use to model the plot.

Percentages based on counting need at least a sample size of 300.

Empirical CDF can create probility of the population.
